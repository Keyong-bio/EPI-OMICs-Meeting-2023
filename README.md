# EPI-OMICs-Meeting-2023
This repository will update the content discussed in **EPI-OMICs-Meeting** coordinated by the OMICs groups from the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, LUMC, the Netherlands.

- We hope to reach out more talents who are interested or expertised at OMICs research. Further collaboration is also very desirable for us.
- Due to our limited capacity, what we discussed might be quite naive now. Any comments or suggestions from you are very welcome! (No matter for the content, methodology, research questions...)
